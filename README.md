# Sberbank Data Science Journey 2018: AutoML

[SDSJ AutoML](https://sdsj.sberbank.ai/ru/contest) â€” AutoML(automatic machine learning) competition aimed at development of machine learning systems for processing banking datasets: transactions, time-series as well as classic table data from real banking operations.
Processing is handled automatically by the system with models selection, architecture, hyper-parameters, etc.

## Solution description

### Preprocessing:

- Drop constant columns
- Add time-shifted columns
- Features from datetime columns (year, weekday, month, day)
- Smoothed target encoding (Semenov encoding) for `string` and `id` columns and if the dataset has more than 1000 rows else and for `numeric` with less than 31 unique values
- If dataset's size bigger than 250Mb than convert data to `np.float32` data-type

### Training:

If dataset has less than 1000 rows (e.g. first dataset) and `regression` problem than train [linear model](#Linear-Model) else [gradient boosting](#Gradient-Boosting) model(s)

#### Linear Model

1. Fill missing values with mean
2. Transform data with [QuantileTransformer][1]
3. Train [Lasso][2] with regularization term alpha = 0.1
4. Search for best alpha for Lasso, [Ridge][3] and select best of them:
    1. Cross-validation: `time_series_split.TimeSeriesCV` with `min(6, number_of_rows / 30)` folds if `datetime_0` in dataset else use [KFold][4] with `3` folds
    2. [Grid search][5] alpha for Lasso in range `np.logspace(-2, 0, n_points)` where `n_points` is min of 35 and estimation of how many times we could train the model on all folds
    3. Grid search alpha Ridge if by estimation we could train more than 2 times on all folds, search for alpha in `np.logspace(-2, 2, n_points)` range
5. If we successfully grid search than select best of Lasso and Ridge else use Lasso from 2.

#### Gradient Boosting

1. Train few iterations of [XGBoost][6] with 700 trees (`early_stopping_rounds=20`) with continuation until we have enough time for next iteration, or early stopping achieved
2. If XGBoosts trains fewer two-thirds of available time than train [LightGBM][7] with 5000 trees (`early_stopping_rounds=20`)
3. If XGBoost and LightGBM trained successfully than stacking them with [Logistic Regression][8] or Ridge according to the prediction problem
